In this section, we gathered some topics which should give you better insight into Membrane. We will base on the ["All you need to know about pipelines pt 1" tutorial](../basic_pipeline/01_Introduction.md), so make sure you have gone through it first.
The chapters are loosely related, so feel free to read them in any order you want.

- [Bin](../basic_pipeline_extension/02_Bin.md) - how to create a reusable group of [elements](../glossary/glossary.md#element)
